# classify.io
Autonomous Waste Segregator for classifying garbage into Inorganic/Organic (I/O)

## Description

Kaggle Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/techsash/waste-classification-data

This project aims to build a working Machine Learning Model to classify everyday materials into Organic and Recyclable materials. We have trained our data on over 22,000 images on different models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines(SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), SVM with features as extracted from CNN, and ResNet. We compared the performance of these models based on different evaluation metrics including, but not limited to accuracy.
